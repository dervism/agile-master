  # Frontpage - Challenges In Large Scale Agile


  ## Abstract

  ## Foreword

  ## Table of Contents (TOC)

  ## Table of Figures

  ## 1. Introduction
  - What do I want to find out
  - How will I find out (short summary of methodology)
  - Project Deliveries (such as applications, concepts)
  - Research Contributions


  ## 2. Literature Overview
  - Overview of Research and Papers
  - Summary of findings


  ## 3. Background
  - History of Agile (RUP, Waterfall, Agile Manifesto etc etc things)
  - Status Quo - Agile today
  - Distributed Agile in real-world companies (such as Visma/Accenture/Capgemini)


  ## 4. Methodology
  - #### Interview With Experts on Agile
    - Interview - What is it, How did I use the method
    - Summary and findings from the interviews
    
  - #### Questionary
    - Questionary - What is it, How did I use the method
    - Summary of findings
    
  - #### Observations
    - Observations - What is it, How did I use the method
    - Summary of findings


  ## 5. Discussion
  - #### Technical Part
    - Continuous Delivery
    - Continuous Integration (and available tools such as PaaS and IaaS)

  - #### Theoretical Part
    - Distributed teams and projects, What, Why, How
    - Team dynamics, What, Why, How
    - Comparison of projects with and without distributed teams (success rate, economy etc)
    - Psychology and Communication in Distributed teams (such as being monitored all the time, or seeing remote people once a day only)
    

    - Customers (and their project managment)
      - Feedback Driven Development
      - Customer expectation / Relevance of what we are building
      - "Sprint" is a bad word - Everything is not about speed


    - Software and Design (architects etc)
      - Big Upfront Design (avoid it. do "enough" design then code, test, innovate and evolve architect "as you go")
      - Avoid PowerPoint architects (rather have architects that code and knows the software)


    - Agile in Programming
      - "You cant be agile, if your code sucks" (developers need to write better code)
      - "Make it work, make it better real soon"
      - Write readable code, read others code


    - How to communicate in a project with hundreds of people / how do select items to work / how to keep track progress
      - Answer (?): Dont have such a huge project


  ## 6. Research Delivery
  - Suggestion for something new - your own ideas
  - Trying out your idea in the real world - observing a group of volunteers
  - Summary of findings


  ## 7. Conclusion
  - Conclusion - What did I find out
  - Further Work (if needed)
